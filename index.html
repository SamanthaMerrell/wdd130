    <p> Utah is a pretty state with lots to do. Not only do moutains you get lakes, waterfalls, hot springs and national parks. Each part of utah is differnt and all of it is beautiful. Things you can do in utah are hike, swim, go exploring, walk around temple square, and go to soda shops. Since moving to Utah I have never seen so many soda shops in my life, infact it's a whole culture. Overall utah is a pretty state and has fun things to do if you decide to visit.</p>
